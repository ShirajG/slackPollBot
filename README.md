# A Polling Utility for Slack

This project provides an easy way for you to take polls in slack.
Just edit the config.js file in the root directory, and place your 
slack token and api keys in there. If you deploy this to a hosting service like 
Heroku, you must set the environment variables for Redis properly as well.
